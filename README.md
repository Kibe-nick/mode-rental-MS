# mode-rental-MS
A full-stack application connecting rental managers and tenants. Features include apartment listings, tenant registration, booking management, notifications, and real-time updates. Built collaboratively as a capstone project to showcase development skills.


## Backend Workflow and Technologies
Overview
The backend of this Rental Management System is built using Python and Flask, providing a robust and scalable foundation for API development. PostgreSQL is used as the database to manage and store rental information efficiently. Additional features include email notifications and integration with M-Pesa Daraja API for payment processing.

## Key Technologies
Python: Core programming language for backend development.
Flask: Lightweight framework for building RESTful APIs.
PostgreSQL: Relational database management system for data persistence.
Email Notification: Used for sending updates such as booking confirmations and reminders.
M-Pesa Daraja API: Enables mobile money transactions for rental payments (to be implemented later).

## Workflow
1. API Development:

RESTful API endpoints will be created to handle core functionalities, such as:
User authentication and authorization.
Apartment listing management.
Booking system for tenants.

2. Database Design:

PostgreSQL will store structured data like:
Apartment details (name, availability, price).
User information (name, role, booking history).
Notifications and payment records.

3. Email Notifications:

Utilize Python libraries like smtplib or Flask-Mail for sending automated emails during key events, such as booking confirmations or maintenance alerts.

3. Payment Integration

The M-Pesa Daraja API will be incorporated to handle rental payments securely.
Borrowing from the Money Transfer App, weâ€™ll ensure seamless mobile payment functionality.
4. Future Enhancements
Refine the email system to handle bulk notifications.
Explore additional third-party APIs for payment methods beyond M-Pesa.
